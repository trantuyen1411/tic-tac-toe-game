As users playing a two player game we want to:
[X] enter our names and have them displayed
[X] have our order chosen for us by the game
[X] take turns placing our marks in empty spaces
[X] not be able to place our marks in an occupied space
[X] be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw. 
[X] start the game over without having to reset the browser
As a user playing a one player game I want to:
[X] see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
[X] have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player with the correct mark in an empty space (computerMove())
As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted to:
[] have the Computer make 'better-than-guessing' choices when placing a mark on the board
[] set the board size myself ("wider" or "taller" than 3x3)---- need to ask, might need the createBoard() function to modify the size of the board
